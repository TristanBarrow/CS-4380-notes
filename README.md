# UVU CS 4380 Notes

## Introduction

This is a place for notes and some discussion for the UVU course CS 4380 on computer Architecture.

No large chunks of code should be put up here so we don't end up cheating or end up getting accused of cheating. Some very small code snippets can be put up here so we can have discussion about it but for larger code snippets we should be linking to other locations on the internet like stack overflow or CPP docs. Please feel free to use this as a wiki or we can just actually use the wiki for this repo as a wiki. 

Another thing I will personally be doing is trying to setup a set of "requirements" or "specs" in a more code friendly format so its easier to develop to those specs. 

## Information that will prepare you for the workplace

I hope to add some extra information to this repo that will also be just "good to know" stuff that you should know for industry so look out for that if you are following this.
